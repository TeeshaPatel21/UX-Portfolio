                <div class="md:flex md:space-x-10 items-center">

                            <strong class="font-bold text-gray-800">Problem:</strong> On most food delivery apps, the "favourites" feature only allows you to save a whole restaurant. This is inconvenient because a user's favorite thing is often a specific dish, not the entire menu. This can lead to frustration and makes it difficult for a user to quickly re-order a dish they loved.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            <strong class="font-bold text-gray-800">Proposed Solution:</strong> I redesigned the feature to allow users to favorite a specific dish directly. By adding a simple "heart" icon next to each dish, users can build a personalized list of their go-to items. This list would display the dish name, a photo, and the restaurant name, making it faster and easier to re-order.

                            <strong class="font-bold text-gray-800">What I Learned:</strong> This project taught me that a good user experience is about anticipating the user's true needs. It's not enough to just add a feature; it needs to be designed in a way that truly solves the user's problem.

                <div class="md:flex md:space-x-10 items-center">

                            <strong class="font-bold text-gray-800">Problem:</strong> When booking movie tickets, many apps present too much information on a single screen-showtimes, seat selection, and food options are all cluttered together. This can overwhelm the user and make the process feel long and confusing, especially on a small phone screen.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            <strong class="font-bold text-gray-800">Proposed Solution:</strong> I broke down the booking process into a simple, three-step user flow. The user would first select their movie and showtime. On the next screen, they would choose their seats. Finally, they would proceed to a separate payment screen. This structured approach guides the user logically through the process, making it feel faster and more organized.

                            <strong class="font-bold text-gray-800">What I Learned:</strong> This case study highlighted the importance of a clean and logical user flow. I learned that by carefully organizing information and presenting it to the user one step at a time, you can drastically improve their experience and reduce frustration.
